\noindent The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate your ability to analyze data involving non-linear/non-continuous outcome data.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent {\em Your task}:
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep1em
\item In this assignment, we provide you with a research question, hypothesis, and outcome variable(s). Your task is to translate the hypotheses into credible regression specifications to identify the hypothesized causal relationship. You will perform this analysis using both cross-sectional and panel data on individuals. 

\item Because we are providing you with the research question, hypothesis, and variables, you should \textit{not} write about these issues in your assignment. You only need to submit the ``results'' section of the paper.

\item 

% research question

% hypothesis

% outcome variables (one binary, one categorical or count)

% logit and probit specifications

% predicted outcome

% average marginal effects

% marginal effects for representative cases

% assess statistical and substantive significance
