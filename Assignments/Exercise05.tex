\maketitle

Examine the data below for five countries at various points in time. Transcribe that data into a dataset that you might be able to analyze in Stata. You may do this using Stata's data editor, Microsoft Excel, a Microsoft Word table, a text editor, or whatever other computer application you choose. Stata or Excel are probably best.

\begin{enumerate}\itemsep2em
\item Description of one country

\item Description of one variable

\item Additional data for that variable at another point in time

\item A table of one variable, with multiple countries listed for each with some missingness

\item Description of another country
\end{enumerate}
