# Quantitative Political Analysis #

Some course materials for the Quantitative Political Analysis seminar in Political Science and Government at Aarhus University. Because the course is cotaught, this is only about half of the course materials. The [release `spring2014`](https://github.com/leeper/regcourse/releases/tag/spring2014) contains all of my materials from the first time I taught the course and that material is still available in the `vSpring2014` branch. The repo is currently being updated with materials for Spring 2015.

These materials can be found at: http://www.thomasleeper.com/regcourse
