## Outline

 1. A little about how Stata works
 
 2. A little bit about graphics
 
 3. Work through S&#248;nderskov Ch.4-5


---
## How Stata works

 1. Load data into memory

 2. You request Stata to do something

 3. If a valid, Stata executes your request and:
  
   a. Stores some of the results temporarily
   b. Prints some of the results to the console

 4. New requests overwrite the stored results

## summarize | sum

```
summarize stores the following in r():

Scalars   
  r(N)           number of observations
  r(mean)        mean
  r(skewness)    skewness (detail only)
  r(min)         minimum
  r(max)         maximum
  r(sum_w)       sum of the weights
  r(p1)          1st percentile (detail only)
  r(p5)          5th percentile (detail only)
  r(p10)         10th percentile (detail only)
  r(p25)         25th percentile (detail only)
  r(p50)         50th percentile (detail only)
  r(p75)         75th percentile (detail only)
  r(p90)         90th percentile (detail only)
  r(p95)         95th percentile (detail only)
  r(p99)         99th percentile (detail only)
  r(Var)         variance
  r(kurtosis)    kurtosis (detail only)
  r(sum)         sum of variable
  r(sd)          standard deviation
```

## `tabulate` | tab

```
tabulate and tab1 store the following in r():

Scalars   
  r(N)           number of observations
  r(r)           number of rows
```

## Implications for using Stata

  - Use do-files to keep track of your code
  
  - Work one operation at a time
    - You can't go back without rerunning your request
    
  - Save output using logs
    
```
log using ...
log off
log on
log close
```

## Graphics

 - Code for graphics is complicated

 - Use the menus and `help` to learn the code
   - Code: http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/graphics/gph/stata-graphs/
   - Menus: http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/4-24.htm

 - Use resources and examples:
   - Cameron and Trivedi 2.6 (pp.58-70)
   - Various places in S&#248;nderskov
   - http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/library/GraphExamples/
   - http://www.survey-design.com.au/Stata%20Graphs.html
