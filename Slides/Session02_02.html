## Graphics

 - Code for graphics is complicated

 - Use the menus and `help` to learn the code
   - See also: http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/4-24.htm

 - Use resources and examples:
   - Cameron and Trivedi 2.6 (pp.58-70)
   - Various places in S&#248;nderskov
   - http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/library/GraphExamples/
   - http://www.survey-design.com.au/Stata%20Graphs.html
