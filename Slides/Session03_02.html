## Outline

 - Model comparison

 - Categorical covariates
 
 - Regression Output
 
 - Work on S&#248;nderskov Ch. 8 (153-185)


---
## Model comparison

 - Sometimes we need to do formal model comparison

 - By default, Stata compares any model to "null" model
   - The "null" model has no independent variables
   
 - To compare multiple "nested" models, use `nestreg`
 
 
---
## Model comparison

```
nestreg: regress growth lcon (lconsq)
```

The key statistic of interest here is the F-statistic

This tells us whether the model yields a statistically significant reduction in the residual sum of squares (i.e., the portion of the variance in the data unexplained by the model)

---
## Categorical covariates

 - Regression on categorical covariates involves either:
   1. Assuming the categories are essentially continuous
   2. Manually creating indicator "dummies" for each level
   3. Using "factor variable" syntax *
   
 - Factor variables are the best general solution:
 
```
reg dv covariate

reg dv i.covariate
```

.footnote[* S&#248;nderskov pp.158-161]

???

The `i.covariate` syntax automatically generates categories.

You can also specify a baseline category explicitly using slightly difference syntax.

And then you can use `test` to compare coefficients across categories.

---
## Categorical covariates

These are the same because `london` is an indicator variable

```
use EnglebertPRQ2000.dta
reg growth london
reg growth i.london
```

---
## Categorical covariates

```
* create a categorical variable
egen warcivcat = cut(warciv), at(0,10,20,30,40)

* continuous covariate
reg growth warciv
reg growth warcivcat

* categorical covariate
reg growth i.warcivcat

* specify baseline
reg growth b30.warcivcat
```




---
## F-test for factors

 - Remember the F-test for model comparison?
 
 - *t*-test will tell us about the significance of each category alone
 
 - We can use the F-test to understand the joint contribution of all categories
 
 - Use `testparm` not `nestreg`!
 

---
## F-test for factors

```
reg growth lcon lconsq warcivcat
testparm warcivcat

reg growth i.warcivcat
testparm i.warcivcat

* nestreg doesn't work for factor variables:
* nestreg: reg growth lcon lconsq (i.warcivcat)
* but it does work for other variables:
nestreg: reg growth (lcon lconsq) (vlegit hlegit)
```

## `regress` | `reg`

```
 regress stores the following in e():

Matrices       
  e(b)                coefficient vector
  e(V)                variance-covariance matrix of the estimators
  e(V_modelbased)     model-based variance

Functions      
  e(sample)           marks estimation sample
```

---
## `regress` | `reg`

What do we do with all those values?

```
help ereturn

* e.g., retrieve coefficients, again
ereturn display
```

---
## Storing residuals and fitted values

```
reg growth lcon
* store fitted values as yhat
predict yhat
* store residuals as resid
predict resid, r
```

---
## Summarizing and plotting

```
graph twoway yhat growth
graph twoway resid lcon
graph twoway resid vlegit
```


---
## Output and export

 - Rarely do we just want results on the console
   - You can save these to a log, but they don't look nice
 
 - Irrelevant information in default output
 
 - We generally want some nicer output


---
## Reporting regression results

 - What is normally reported from a regression model?
 
   1. Coefficients
   
   2. Standard errors (or *t*-statistics)
   
   3. Significance stars
   
   4. `\(R^2\)` or Adjusted-`\(R^2\)` 

---
## Reporting regression results

 - What should we report from a regression model?
 
   - Coefficients
   
   - Confidence intervals or standard errors
   
   - Measures of model fit
     1. RMSE (`\(\hat{\sigma}\)`)
     2. Adjusted-`\(R^2\)`
     
   - Model-specific sample size (*n*)

---
## `display`

If we just want one value, we can pull them from `e()`

```
* return all values from e()
ereturn list

* display a single value
display e(N)
display e(rmse)

* display coefficients
matrix list e(b)
```



---
## `estimates`

We can store results and then print them nicely

```
quietly reg growth lcon
estimates store small
* print results
estimates table
* print results with summary stats
estimates table, se stats(N r2_a)
* format printing of coefs/SEs
estimates table small large, b(%9.2f) se(%9.2f) stats(N r2_a)
```

.footnote[Lots of options, see: `help estimates table`]

---
## `estimates`

We can also combine multiple objects:

```
quietly reg growth lcon lconsq
estimates store large

estimates table small large
estimates table small large, se stats(N r2_a)
```

---
## User-defined programs

 - Stata does a lot but users can also improve it
 - It's easy to install user-defined programs from the web


---
## User-defined programs

 - Install user-defined program `estout`:
 
```
ssc install estout, replace 
```
 
 
.footnote[See http://repec.org/bocode/e/estout/index.html]


---
## Using the `estout` program

Two functions:

 - `esttab`: Simple regression tables
 - `estout`: Better formatted tables

.red[Use `esttab`!]

 - `eststo`: Store multiple models


---
.left-column[
## estout
]
.right-column[
```
reg growth lcon
estout
```

.footnote[There are lots of options: `help estout`]
]


---
.left-column[
## estout
## esttab
]
.right-column[
```
reg growth lcon
* print results (but note t-statistics by default)
esttab
* better formatting
esttab, b(%9.2f) se(%9.2f)
```

.footnote[There are lots of options: `help esttab` (and `help format`)]
]

---
.left-column[
## estout
## esttab
## eststo
]
.right-column[

```
quietly reg growth lcon
eststo

quietly reg growth lcon lconsq
eststo

estout, b(%9.2f) se(%9.2f) stats(rmse)
esttab, b(%9.2f) se(%9.2f) stats(rmse)
```
]
