 - Different formulae for computing `\( R^2 \)`
   - In OLS, they all produce the same result
   - In GLMs, they produce different results
   
 - Which is correct?

We'll talk about this a bit in lab, but goodness-of-fit is not something we think you should worry too much about in these kinds of models
