## Goodness of fit

 - Percent Correctly Classified

 - Likelihood Ratio

 - Pseudo-`\(R^2\)`

 - Different formulae for computing `\( R^2 \)`
   - In OLS, they all produce the same result
   - In GLMs, they produce different results
   
 - Which is correct?

We'll talk about this a bit in lab, but goodness-of-fit is not something we think you should worry too much about in these kinds of models

## Goodness of fit in Stata

```
findit spostado
* install spost9_ado
```

This includes several commands:

 - `fitstats` (Goodness of fit)
 - `prvalue` (Predicted Probabilities)
 - `prchange` (MEs)

---
## The `fitstats` command

## Interactions in OLS




???

Review interactions in OLS

Interaction is a difference-in-differences


---
## Interactions in logistic regression


???

Interaction is still a difference-in-differences

But how do we measure the difference? In logits (log odds)? Odds? In predicted probabilities?

## Predicted probabilities with interactions

## Marginal effects with interactions
