## Outcome determines modeling strategy

 1. How many alternatives in the choice set?
 
 2. Are those alternatives ordered?
 
 3. Are those alternatives counts?


???

 1. Number of alternatives
   - If 2, logit or probit
   - If more: continue
   
 2. Are they ordered?
   - Yes: ordered logit or probit
   - No: continue
 
 3. Counts?
   - Yes: Poisson or beta-binomial
   - No: Multinomial logit

## Latent variable
    - Latent variable which is predicted by our model then translated via a link function
    - The logic is the same as the binary model, but we now have more categories
    - Thus we're not trying to figure out `\(Pr(y_i=1)\)`, but `\(Pr(y_i=t)\)` for all categories, `\(t\)`, of the outcome
      - All probabilities have to sum to 1
    - This can get very complicated

## Ordered models
      - Logit
        - Assumptions
      - Probit
        - Assumptions
## Count models
      - Poisson
      - Quasi-poisson
      - Negative binomial
      - Some others (beta-binomial, various zero-inflated models)        
## Multinomial models
      - Logit
      - Probit
      - Conditional models
