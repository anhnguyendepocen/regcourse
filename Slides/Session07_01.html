 - Other categorical outcomes

## Outcome determines modeling strategy

 1. How many alternatives in the choice set?
 
 2. Are those alternatives ordered?
 
 3. Are those alternatives counts?


???

 1. Number of alternatives?
   - If 2, logit or probit
   - If more: continue
   
 2. Are they ordered?
   - Yes: ordered logit or probit
   - No: continue
 
 3. Counts?
   - Yes: Poisson, negative-binomial, etc.
   - No: Multinomial logit or probit

## Other scenarios

 - Conditional logit/probit
 
 - Nested logit/probit
 
 - Mixed logit
 
 - Tobit models for censored data
   - e.g., survival data

???

We are not going to talk about these

## Latent variable

 - Latent variable which is predicted by our model then translated via a link function

 - The logic is the same as the binary model, but we now have more categories

 - Thus we're not trying to figure out `\(Pr(y_i=1)\)`, but `\(Pr(y_i=t)\)` for all categories, `\(t\)`, of the outcome
   - All probabilities have to sum to 1

 - This can get very complicated

## An example: Danish Grading Scale


???

Performance as a latent variable

Manifest categories

You are probabilistically in any category, but we figure out which of those grades is best (has the highest probability)

## Ordered models

 - Logit
   - Assumptions

 - Probit
   - Assumptions

   
   
---
## Count models

 - Poisson
 - Quasi-poisson
 - Negative binomial
 - Some others (beta-binomial, various zero-inflated models)        

---
## Multinomial models

  - Logit

  - Probit

  - Conditional models
