## Binary models (continued)
  - Categorical independent variables
  - Marginal effects
  - Interactions

## Maximum likelihood estimation
  - (Train ch. 8)
  - Likelihood function
    - Set of observed data values
    - Try to fit a model to those data (i.e., attach parameter estimates to a function relating covariate(s) to outcome)
    - The likelihood is the probability of observing the data given the parameter estimates
    - This probability comes from a parametric function (e.g., a normal distribution)
  - Likelihood maximization
    - We want to arrive at the parameter estimates that maximize the likelihood
    - How? Guess!
      - Start with some kind of guess and calculate the likelihood
      - Make better and better guesses, until the likelihood doesn't get marginally higher
      - Example Stata output showing MLE estimate iterations
    - Example of a maximum likelihood estimate of the mean
      - The mean has a closed form solution, so this is trivial
    - Example of a maximum likelihood estimate of a linear model
      - This is equivalent to the OLS estimate

## MLE Applications
  - MLE becomes a general mechanism of estimating parameters
  - This allows us to estimate all kinds of models
  - Latent variable
    - Latent variable which is predicted by our model then translated via a link function
    - The logic is the same as the binary model, but we now have more categories
    - Thus we're not trying to figure out `\(Pr(y_i=1)\)`, but `\(Pr(y_i=t)\)` for all categories, `\(t\)`, of the outcome
      - All probabilities have to sum to 1
    - This can get very complicated
  - Other GLMs
    - Ordered models
      - Logit
        - Assumptions
      - Probit
        - Assumptions
    - Count models
      - Poisson
      - Quasi-poisson
      - Negative binomial
      - Some others (beta-binomial, various zero-inflated models)        
    - Multinomial models
      - Logit
      - Probit
      - Conditional models
