Review when we use different types of models


---
class: center, middle

When do we use **binary logit** versus **binary probit**?

???

 - Only important difference is untestable assumption about error term


---
class: center, middle

When do we use **ordered logit** versus **ordered probit**?


???

 - Same as in binary logit/probit

---
class: center, middle

When do we use **OLS** versus **ordered probit**?

???

 - Ordered, but not interval outcome
 
 - Ex: Spending opinion variable: increased/decreased/same
 
 - Can they give the same substantive results? How would we know?


---
class: center, middle

When do we use **OLS** versus **poisson**?

???

 - Upper bound to variable
 
 - Distribution of count variable (Normal, Poisson, zero-inflated, negative-binomial)
 
 - If the count is a proportion of a number of finite trials, you actually want logit/probit

---
class: center, middle

When do we use **ordered logit** versus **multinomial logit**?

???

 - Categories can be ordered or not
 
 - Choice of logit/probit is same as in binary logit/probit


---
class: center, middle

When do we use **multinomial logit** versus several **binary logit**s?

 - We want to constrain probabilities to sum to one

<!-- Model Interpretation -->

---
class: center, middle

In OLS, how do we determine the statistical significance of a covariate?

---
class: center, middle

In a GLM, how do we determine the statistical significance of a covariate?


---
class: center, middle

In OLS with a product term, how do we determine the substantive size of a covariate's effect?

---
class: center, middle

In a GLM with a product term, how do we determine the substantive size of a covariate's effect?


???

 - Latent scale
 
 - Probability scale
 
 - Are they always the same?

---
class: center, middle

In OLS, what is the difference between the coefficient/slope and the marginal effect of a variable?


---
class: center, middle

In a GLM, what is the difference between the coefficient/slope and the marginal effect of a variable?


---
class: center, middle

In a GLM, why do we calculate predicted probabilities?

???

 - Average Predicted Probabilities
 
 - Predicted probabilities at representative cases

---
class: center, middle

In a GLM, why do we calculate marginal effects?

???

 - Average marginal effects versus marginal effects at the mean
 
 - Comparing effect sizes in probability terms
