## Pop Quiz

???

Review when we use different types of models

I'm going to put questions on the board

Spend 10 seconds individually and think of an answer


---
class: center, middle

When do we use **binary logit** versus **binary probit**?

???

 - Outcome that is a binary/dummy/indicator (0/1)

 - Only important difference is untestable assumption about error term


---
class: center, middle

When do we use **ordered logit** versus **ordered probit**?


???

 - The outcome is a set of categories that can be ordered from highest to lowest
 
 - Categories do not need to be equidistant
 
 - Same as in binary logit/probit

---
class: center, middle

When do we use **OLS** versus **ordered probit**?

???

 - Ordered, but not interval outcome
 
 - Ex: Spending opinion variable: increased/decreased/same
 
 - Can they give the same substantive results? How would we know?
 
 - Worth doing robustness checks


---
class: center, middle

When do we use **OLS** versus **poisson**?

???

 - Upper bound to variable
 
 - Distribution of count variable (Normal, Poisson, zero-inflated, negative-binomial)
 
 - Versus Normal distribution
 
 - If the count is a proportion of a number of finite trials, you actually want logit/probit

When do we use **ordered logit** versus **multinomial logit**?

???

 - Categories can be ordered or not
 
 - Multinomial logit will still work with an ordered outcome
 
 - Choice of logit/probit is same as in binary logit/probit


---
class: center, middle

When do we use **multinomial logit** versus several **binary logits**?


???

 - We want to constrain probabilities to sum to one

In OLS, how do we determine the statistical significance of a covariate?

---
class: center, middle

In a GLM, how do we determine the statistical significance of a covariate?


---
class: center, middle

In OLS with a product term, how do we determine the substantive size of a covariate's effect?

???

Key is that there are multiple effect sizes for included covariates

---
class: center, middle

In a GLM with a product term, how do we determine the substantive size of a covariate's effect?


???

 - Latent scale
 
 - Probability scale
 
 - Are they always the same?

---
class: center, middle

In OLS, what is the difference between the coefficient/slope and the marginal effect of a variable?


???

They are the same

---
class: center, middle

In a GLM, what is the difference between the coefficient/slope and the marginal effect of a variable?

???

They are the same on the latent scale (e.g., in logit, on the logit scale)

On the probability scale, the marginal effect depends on all other variables


---
class: center, middle

In a GLM, why do we calculate predicted probabilities?

???

 - Average Predicted Probabilities
 
 - Predicted probabilities at representative cases

---
class: center, middle

In a GLM, why do we calculate marginal effects?

???

 - Average marginal effects versus marginal effects at the mean
 
 - Comparing effect sizes in probability terms 


---
class: center, middle

For which covariates should we estimate marginal effects and/or predicted probabilities?

???

The ones we care about theoretically

Everything we said in OLS about causal inference and hypothesis testing applies with GLMs
