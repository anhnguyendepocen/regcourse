## Mimic experiment by matching across covariates
  - Define treatment and control groups
  - Independence assumption
    - Achieved by randomization
  - Conditional ignorability
    - Not independence (which is not testable)
  - Trivial example with one covariate
  - Consequences
    - Covariate balance across treatment groups
    - Eliminate covariate non-overlap
    - Potentially discard a lot of observations
      - Is this a good thing or a bad thing?
      - Loss of representativeness
      - 1-to-1 or 1-to-k or k-to-k matching
---
## Problem of dimensionality
  - As number and levels of covariates increase, too many levels to match at
  - Solutions
    - CEM
    - Propensity score
    - Mahalanobis distance (we won't discuss this)
---
## Propensity score matching
  - Estimate a logistic regression model
    - Outcome: treatment variable
    - Predictors: covariates
  - Match on the fitted values, as a single covariate
    - Use either the logit scale or predicted probability
  - Benefits
    - Solves the dimensionality problem
    - Balancing covariates
  - Consequences
    - Model dependence!
    - No guarantee of covariate balance

## How do we use matched data?
  - Difference-in-means based on matched data
    - Weighted difference (ATT/ATC)
  - Regression on preprocessed data
