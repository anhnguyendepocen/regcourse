## Let's review!

 1. What is matching? How does it work?

 2. Why do we do it?

 3. How do we know when our data our sufficiently matched?

## How do we know when units are sufficiently matched?

 - Common covariate support
 
 - Covariate (mean) balance
 
 - Identical covariate distributions

???

Because there are unobserved covariates, we can never really know

This is also a problem for regression; there are always omitted variables

 1. We get common covariate support in any matching exercise
 
 2. Mean balance is something we have to test (exact matching ignores it)
 
   - We can do t-test, but do we need exactly identical means?
   - Do we look at the propensity score or individual covariates?
 
 3. Identical distributions

   - Is it necessary?
   - How do we test?

## Matching vs. Experiments


???

Experiments only guarantee balance in expectation; that's what allows us to make a causal inference

Matching focuses on balance in this realization of the data - so it's actually making the standard for drawing a causal inference higher than what is requied for causal inference.

## Aside: Exact matching

 - In **exact matching** we do not need to check balance
 
 - All variables that we match on are, by definition, balanced

What lingering questions do you have about matching?
