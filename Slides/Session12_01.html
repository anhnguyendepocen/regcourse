IV focuses on estimating a Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) by finding some real-world randomization to "instrument" for the causal variable

So-called "natural experiments", "regression discontinuity designs", and "interrupted time series" are all basically instrumental variables designs


---
## When do we use instrumental variables?

 1. Measurement error
 
 2. Endogeneity
 

---

???

Causal graph


---
## Instruments



---
## IV Estimation


---
## Two-Stage Least Squares



---
## IV in Stata

---
## Standard Errors

---
## Why not logit/probit?

 - Builds distributional assumptions into our estimate
 


---
## IV Assumptions


---
## Causal graphs
  - Backdoor criterion, again

---
## Instruments
 
 - Credible/strong instruments
 
 - Weak instruments
 
???

Weak instruments give big SEs

## IV Credibility Checklist

???

Sovey and Green checklist

---
## Activity

 - List of instruments used in literature  
  
---
## Experiments and lotteries as instruments
  - Conscription/Draft lotteries
  - Boundaries as discontinuities
  - Regression discontinuity (class size)

---
## Forward vs. Backward Causal Inference

 - Forward causal inference
 
 - Backward causal inference
  
???

IV can be used for both
