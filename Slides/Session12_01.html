IV focuses on estimating a Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) by finding some real-world randomization to "instrument" for the causal variable

So-called "natural experiments", "regression discontinuity designs", and "interrupted time series" are all basically instrumental variables designs


---
## When do we use instrumental variables?

 1. Measurement error
 
 2. Confounding with unobservables
 
???

Because confounding is with unobserved factors, we can't use regression or matching

Causal graph

In regression and matching, we previously focused on closing backdoor paths.

With IV, we focus on finding a variable that precedes our putatively causal variable and that exogenously influences it.


---
## Carrubba (2001)

 - What is his argument?

--

 - Draw a causal graph of his causal argument.
 
--

 - Share with the person sitting next to you.
 
???

Have everyone come up and draw their graph


---
## Instruments

Instruments have to satisfy two properties:

 1. **Exogeneity**
 
 2. **Relevance**

???

What does **exogeneity** mean?

What does **relevance** mean?

 

---
## Instruments

Instruments have to satisfy two properties:

 1. **Exogeneity**
 
   - `\( Z \)` temporally precedes `\( X \)`
   
   - `\( Cov(Z, \epsilon) = 0 \)`
 
 2. **Relevance**

   - `\( Z \)` related to `\( X \)`
   
   - `\( Cov(Z, X) \neq 0 \)`

 
---
## Instruments

 - **Exogeneity** is not testable

???

Why?

--

 - **Relevance** is testable

???

Why? How?
 
 
---
## Carrubba (2001)

 - What are Carrubba's instruments?
 
--

 - Are they exogenous?
 
--

 - Are they relevant?

---
## IV Estimation

 - Several ways to estimate IV model
 
 - We'll focus on Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)
 
???

The reason for this is that 2SLS is flexible to multiple instruments

---
## Two-Stage Least Squares

 - `\( Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{Confounded} + \epsilon \)`
 
 - Estimate of `\( \beta_1 \)` is biased
 
--

 - `\( X_{Confounded} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Z_{Instrument} + \nu \)`
 
 - `\( Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1^{2SLS} \hat{X} + \epsilon \)`



---
## 2SLS IV Estimation in Stata

```
quietly reg endogenous instrument
predict fitted

* simple estimation
reg outcome fitted

* estimation with additional covariates
reg outcome fitted covariates
```

---
## Standard Errors

 - Standard errors for IV estimates need to incorporate variance in Z
 
 - So, the doing 2SLS manually produces incorrect SEs

 - Luckily, `ivregress` provides functionality directly:

```
ivregress 

NEED TO HASH OUT FULL EXAMPLE CALL

```

---
## Standard Errors

 - SEs are going to be large in 2SLS than OLS
 
 - We can still use heteroskedasticity-consistent SEs in second stage
 
???

2SLS is less efficient than OLS which means:

 1. If we can eliminate confounding through straight OLS, we should do it
 
 2. If we have to do 2SLS, we need a larger sample size to obtain the same SEs. Thus it's harder to detect significant effects.

Should we use robust SEs in first stage? No, because we don't care about them...they're irrelevant for generating `\( \hat{X} \)`

---
## An Aside

 - Image the confounded variable `\( X \)` is an 0/1 indicator
 
 - Should we use logit/probit to estimate the first stage equation?

???

No. Builds distributional assumptions into our estimate.

WU-HAUSMAN TEST

In Stata:

```
estat endogenous
```


---
## Causal graphs

  - Backdoor criterion, again

---
## Instruments
 
 - Credible/strong instruments
 
 - Weak instruments
 
???

Weak instruments give big SEs


---
## How many instruments?

 1. Exactly identified
 
   - Same number of instruments as confounded variables
 
 2. Overidentified
 
   - More instruments than confounded variables
 
 3. Underidentified
 
   - Fewer instruments than confounded variables

???

Realistically it is pretty rare in the published literature to use more than one instrument. This is generally because it's hard to find one instrument, let alone multiple.


---

OVERIDENTIFYING RESTRICTIONS

In Stata:

```
estat overid
```

???



---
## Instruments versus treatments

 - How does an instrument differ from a treatment variable?
 
 - In other words, if instruments are so good why don't we just look at their direct effects on `\( Y \)`?
 
???

Well, technically an instrument should have no direct effect on Y.

And, most instruments (at least in empirical literature) are things we don't actually care about.

If your instrument is actually a randomized experimental treatment, then we may care about it.

---
## IV Checklist

 1. How/why is the instrument exogenous?
 
 2. How strong is the instrument?
 
 3. Are there other possible instruments?

???

Sovey and Green checklist

 1. Instrument must temporally precede the putatively causal variable. There must be no backdoor paths through the instrument to the outcome, nor variables that confound the relationship between the instrument and the putative cause.
 
 2. The instrument must be related to the putative cause.
 
 3. Is this the only available instrument? Are there possibly stronger instruments? What other instruments have been used?

---
## Activity

 - List of instruments used in published literature
 
 - Assess credibility of the instruments
  
---
## Forward vs. Backward Causal Inference

 - Forward causal inference
 
 - Backward causal inference
  
???

IV can be used for both


---
## Experiments and lotteries as instruments
  - Conscription/Draft lotteries
  - Boundaries as discontinuities
  - Regression discontinuity (class size)
