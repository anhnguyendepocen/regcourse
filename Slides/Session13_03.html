For the exam, it is not important what strategy you take to address missing data. You can use any method including listwise deletion. You just need to justify your choice. This means you should somewhere discuss missingness in your data (e.g., using `mvpatterns` to understand where missing data are).


---
## Missing Data

 - Missing data is prevalent
 
 - Response depends on assumptions about *why* data are missing
 
 - We can improve efficiency through imputation
 
 - Single imputation will be biased
 
 - Multiple imputation never worse than listwise deletion, but may not reduce bias
 
---
## Missing Data

 - If MCAR, listwise deletion unbiased but inefficient
 
 - If MAR/ignorable, listwise deletion may be unbiased but inefficient
   - We can't know if missigness is ignorable
 
 - If Nonignorable, you're stuck unless you have:
   - Censoring
   - Truncation/Sample selection bias

---
## Censoring/Truncation

 - We don't observe a continuous outcome distribution
 
 - Above and/or below some tresholds we have no units
 
 - Censoring
   - Units above/below the threshold on a latent scale are code at the threshold
   - E.g., "top-coding" or "bottom-coding"
 
 - Truncation
   - Units above/below the threshold are unobserved
 
 - We essentially have a range of missing latent values for some units
 
---
## Censoring/Truncation

 - Latent variable model (like logit/probit)
 
 - Increases in covariates increase the latent variable `\( Y\star \)`
 
 - Above (or below) some treshold, all values of `\( Y\star \)` manifest as the same `\( Y \)` value
 
 - For example:
   - Education increases income, but by how much?
   - Income is continuous
   - If censored: We top code everyone who makes >800.000kr
   - If truncated: We have no data for those who make >800.000kr


---
## Analyzing Censoring

 - We can analyze this with a Tobit model
 
 - Think of it as a generalization of Probit
 
 - We model both:
 
   - Whether we observe `\( Y\star \)` given covariates
   - The value of `\( Y\star \)` given covariates
   
 - Same model explains both
 

---
## Truncation/Sample Selection Bias

 - `\( X \)` is correlated with factor(s) that predict whether a unit is observed
 
 - Coefficients are biased because we have missing outcome data for units not in the sample
 
 - For example:
   - Whether someone runs for office is nonrandom
   - Women less likely to run than men
   - Women who run may differ from those who don't run for reasons correlated with their electoral success
   - We don't observe electoral success for those who do not run
 

---
## Heckmann Correction

 - Come up with a model of the outcome
 
 - Get data for those with and without missing outcome data
 
 - Predict selection into sample as a function of any covariates
   - Must have one covariate here that is not in outcome equation
 
 - Include the predicted probabilities of being in the sample as an additional regressor in the outcome equation
 
 - Estimate using OLS (but get correct SEs!)

 - Tobit is a special case of this
   - The latent outcome is the latent selection propensity
   - Factors explaining selection also explain outcome

## Questions?

## Putting everything together

 - Look at the Simmons and Hopkins text

 - What are all of the statistical techniques they describe?
 
???

We've given you a bunch of different tools.

You may find yourself in situations where you need some of them.

They need not be used in isolation. Sometimes they play well together.
