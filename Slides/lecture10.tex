\section{Essay 2}


% causal graphs vs. linear path models vs. ``heuristic'' theoretical drawings




% graphing and interpretation activity

% we are estimating coefficients for an equation

% using estimates, we can create predicted or fitted values based on input values

% graph these predicted values





\section{Review GLMs and MLE}


% ways of thinking about this

% transforming outcome to a continuous scale so that we can estimate effects

% latent utility

% latent variable



\frame{

\frametitle{The Likelihood Function}
 
 - Takes possible population parameters as inputs
   - i.e., guess at `\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)`
   
 - Give a *likelihood* of seeing our sample data given that input
   - i.e., the probability of observing the data given the parameter guesses
 
 - We pick best guess
   - i.e., the guesses at `\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)` that yield the *maximum* likelihood

}


\frame{

\frametitle{Maximizing the likelihood}

How do we find the maximum likelihood (and thus our estimated `\(\beta\)`'s)?

We guess! Repeatedly!
  
  - Start with some kind of guess and calculate the likelihood
  
  - Make better and better guesses, until the likelihood doesn't get marginally higher

}




% assumptions




\section{Interpreting GLMs}

% activity discussing one of the assigned articles (Hobolt maybe?)




% coefficients in logit and probit

% average marginal effects
% marginal effects at the mean
% marginal effects at representative values

% latent scale versus probability scale

\frame{

What is the probability that $y_i=1|\boldsymbol{x}_i$ ?

}


% marginal effects (slope of the response curve)
% discrete changes
%% there is no difference in linear additive (i.e., many OLS) models because the effect of X is constant across levels of X



% graphing predicted probabilities
% graphing marginal effects



% interaction terms


\section{Model Specification}

% logit versus probit

% binary, categorical, ordered outcomes

% robust SEs - don't necessarily make sense in a GLM context


% elaborating beyond binary outcomes (ordered, categorical, count)
