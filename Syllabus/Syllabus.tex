%\section{Introduction}

Individuals working in the public and private sectors are often tasked with analyzing quantitative data or making use of analyses performed by others. The purpose of this course is to expand and improve significantly participants' ability to perform quantitative analyses of political science data and, further, to better evaluate the use of quantitative research results. Several advanced statistical and analytic techniques will be introduced and applied to research questions from political science. Participants will leave the course with the ability to better assess published research, better perform their own analyses of quantitative data, and better describe and understand the results of such analyses. 

\vspace{1em}
Among others, the course will discuss the following techniques and topics:

\begin{itemize*}
\item Linear regression analysis
\item Interpretation of interactions in regression models
\item Regression with binary, categorical, and count outcomes
\item Analysis of data gathered over time and across geographies
\item Research design for causal inference 
\item Using Stata for statistical analysis
\end{itemize*}

In addition, topics such as hypothesis generation and research design will be discussed throughout the course. The course does not have a unified theoretical or empirical focus, but we will touch upon and read empirical literature from most areas of political science including comparative politics, public administration, and international relations.

\vspace{1em}
Each week, the course will consist of two sessions:

\begin{itemize*}
\item Lecture % add location and time when available
\item Hands-on lab session % add location and time when available
\end{itemize*}


\clearpage
\section{Objectives}
The learning objectives for the course are as follows. By the end of the course, students should be able to:

\begin{enumerate*}
\item Describe politically relevant research questions and hypotheses
\item Evaluate and deduce observable implications from political science theories 
\item Explain statistical procedures and their appropriate usages
\item Apply statistical procedures to relevant research problems
\item Synthesize results from statistical analyses into well-written and well-structured essays
\item Demonstrate how to use Stata for statistical analysis
\end{enumerate*}

\section{Exam and Weekly Assignments}

\subsection{Exam (Only for MA/Kandidater)}
The final exam is a seven-day written assignment analyzing a topic outlined by the instructors using quantitative data. In addition, the students must write four essays during the course on topics defined by the instructors as a prerequisite for the exam

The essays (3-5 pages) must be written in English and are due via email to the appropriate instructor at 12:00 on the dates listed below. The students will receive feedback on the essays and they must all be approved before taking the final exam.

\begin{enumerate*}
\item Essay 1 due February 27 to David % Something on OLS?
\item Essay 2 due March 20 to Thomas % Something on causality/research design?
\item Essay 3 due April 10 to David % Something on panel/multilevel?
\item Essay 4 due May 1 to Thomas % Something on GLM?
\end{enumerate*}

\subsection{For PhD Students}

Students can choose from the following course elements:

\begin{enumerate*}
\item ``Regression with Matrices and MLE'' (1 essay, 2 ECTS)
\item Sessions 1--5 (1 essay, 7 ECTS)
\item Sessions 1--5, plus one additional session (2 essays, 9 ECTS)
\item Sessions 1--5, plus two additional sessions (3 essays, 11 ECTS)
\item Sessions 1--5, plus three additional sessions (3 essays, 12 ECTS)
\item Entire course (4 essays, 15 ECTS)
\end{enumerate*}

PhD students must notify the course instructors of their choice by the end of Session 5.

\section{Reading Material}
The assigned material for the course includes about 2400 pages including several textbooks and empirical research articles, all of which are available online or in the printed course packet. All readings should be completed for the day they are described. {\em There is reading assigned on the first day.} The textbooks for the course are as follows:\\

\reading{CameronTrivedi2010}
\reading{Sonderskov2011}
\reading{AngristPischke2008}
\reading{Long1997}
\reading{Allison2009} % Panel book
%\reading{} % OLS book
% others?

PhD students are additionally required to obtain:
