# Quantitative Political Analysis Seminar #

Some course materials for the Quantitative Political Analysis seminar at Aarhus University. Because I'm co-teaching, this is only about half of the course materials. The course was taught in Spring 2014 and will be taught again in Spring 2015. This website reflects the most recent version of the materials.
